I was an MTech (Research) student in the Computer Science and Automation (CSA) department of Indian Institute of Science(IISc). I am interested in practical and theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning. Specifically, I am interested in transfering knowledge of RL agent from one task to other to improve sample efficiency of algorithm.

I started my exploration of reinforcement learning under the supervision of <a href="https://www.shishirny.com/">Prof. Shishir N. Y.</a> and <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/">Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar</a> and developed average reward off-policy algorithm with deterministic policy. Further under the supervision of <a href="https://www.pushpakjagtap.com/">Prof. Pushpak Jagtap</a> I worked on the developement of reward shaping mechanism that provides a curriculum based guidance to satisfy time dependent environement constraints.

I am highly inspired by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html">Prof. Sridhar Mahadevan's</a> answer on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-reinforcement-learning-a-dead-end/answer/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6?ch=10&oid=115049688&share=2886e070&srid=uaNfO&target">Quora</a> highlighting the importance of transfer mechanism in RL and I look forward to work on empowering the RL agents with ability to transfer knowledge acquired from one task to the other. To that effect I am interested in topics such as Hierarchical RL, Model-Based RL and Curriculum Learning to achieve my long-term goal of transfer learning in RL.
