Robot Learning and Controls (Spring 2023)
======

I taught the following reinforcement learning topics as part of the course:
1. Dynamic Programming for finite horizon problems
2. Value Iteration and Policy Iteration for infinite horizon problems
3. Q-learning and SARSA: Tabular and function approximation methods.
4. Policy Evaluation Algorithms: Monte Carlo and TD(0).
5. Policy Gradient method and Actor-Critic algorithm.

The above mentioned topics are covered as part of three letures: [Lecture 1](https://namansaxena9.github.io/files/RL_Lecture1.pdf), [Lecture 2](https://namansaxena9.github.io/files/RL_Lecture2.pdf) and [Lecture 3](https://namansaxena9.github.io/files/RL_Lecture3.pdf).
